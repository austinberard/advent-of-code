## Project Structure

```
advent-of-code-2024/
├── day-01.py
├── day-02.py
└── ...
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Running Solutions

Each day's solution can be run independently:

```bash
python day-01.py
```

And it will expect an input file in the format `day-xx.py`:

```python
with open("day-01.py") as ...
```
